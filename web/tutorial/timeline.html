<h1>Navigating the Timeline</h1>

  <p>At the very bottom of the default Blender screen layout is a window called the <b>timeline</b>. This gives you an overview of your animation.</p>
  <img src="./tutorial/blendertimeline.png" class="img-responsive">
  <p>Note: There are two elements that look kind of like timelines on the Blender screen. For now, you only need to pay attention to the one on the bottom</p>
  <p>The numbers across the bottom are frame numbers, with your animation starting at frame 1. 
  The light grey background indicates the total duration of the animation. 
  The vertical green line is positioned at the current frame time, and the current frame number is also displayed in a text field at the bottom of the timeline panel, and at the lower left of the viewport in the 3D view window. 
  </p>
  <p>Try navigating the timeline as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Jump to any frame in the animation by left-clicking the desired position on the timeline.</li>
    <li>Hop forward and backward a frame at a time with the left- and right-arrow keys.</li>
    <li>Zoom the view in and out with the mouse wheel, or scroll left and right with the middle mouse button.</li>
    <li>"Scrub" by dragging with the left mouse button across the timeline, causing the animation to run backwards or forwards at whatever speed you choose.</li>
    </ul>
